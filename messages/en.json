            "intro": "In 2026, a service will appear on the Uzbekistan market that will change the approach to intercity trips. Yo'ldosh is not just an app for finding ride companions — it’s a solution to a problem faced daily by thousands of Uzbekistanis.",
            "problem": {
                "title": "The problem we solve",
                "content": "If you’ve ever looked for a ride from Tashkent to Samarkand, Bukhara, or any other city in Uzbekistan, you know how it works: endless Telegram groups, posting your phone number, a flood of calls from dozens of drivers, long price and condition negotiations. This process wastes time, nerves, and doesn’t guarantee you’ll find exactly what you need.",
                "solution": "That’s why we created Yo'ldosh — a centralized platform where drivers and passengers find each other quickly, conveniently, and safely, without revealing personal contacts or endless negotiations."

The app instantly shows a list of available rides from drivers going your route. You can choose a car, review the conditions, check the price, and book a seat — all without a single call. A special feature of our service is the ability to plan trips in advance."

Any citizen of Uzbekistan over 18 with a personal car can become a driver. During registration, you’ll need to upload photos of your driver’s license and vehicle technical passport.",
                    "benefits": "The main advantage for drivers — no more wasting time searching for passengers and endless calls. You publish a trip with your price, and passengers find you themselves. You set the price, not the passengers."
