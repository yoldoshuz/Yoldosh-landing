            "title": "Yo'ldosh: A new era of intercity travel in Uzbekistan",
            "intro": "In 2026, a service will appear on the Uzbekistan market that will change the approach to intercity trips. Yo'ldosh is not just an app for finding ride companions — it’s a solution to a problem faced daily by thousands of Uzbekistanis.",
            "problem": {
                "title": "The problem we solve",
                "content": "If you’ve ever looked for a ride from Tashkent to Samarkand, Bukhara, or any other city in Uzbekistan, you know how it works: endless Telegram groups, posting your phone number, a flood of calls from dozens of drivers, long price and condition negotiations. This process wastes time, nerves, and doesn’t guarantee you’ll find exactly what you need.",
                "solution": "That’s why we created Yo'ldosh — a centralized platform where drivers and passengers find each other quickly, conveniently, and safely, without revealing personal contacts or endless negotiations."
            },
            "howItWorks": {
                "title": "How Yo'ldosh works",
                "intro": "We made the process as simple and clear as possible. All you need to get started is to register with your phone number. After that, you get access to the platform’s main features.",
                "passengers": {
                    "title": "For passengers:",
                    "content": "Specify the main parameters of your trip: where you’re going from and to, departure date, and number of passengers. The app instantly shows a list of available rides from drivers going your route. You can choose a car, review the conditions, check the price, and book a seat — all without a single call. A special feature of our service is the ability to plan trips in advance."

                    "title": "For drivers:",
                    "registration": "To start carrying passengers through Yo'ldosh, you need to go through a simple registration. Any citizen of Uzbekistan over 18 with a personal car can become a driver. During registration, you’ll need to upload photos of your driver’s license and vehicle technical passport.",
                    "benefits": "The main advantage for drivers — no more wasting time searching for passengers and endless calls. You publish a trip with your price, and passengers find you themselves. You set the price, not the passengers."

                "benefit": "Thanks to prepayment, we act as a guarantor that the trip will happen. By booking a seat, the passenger confirms their serious intention, and the driver gains confidence in tomorrow."
